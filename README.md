# Airdrop Contract

## Overview
This repository contains a Plutus smart contract for managing airdrops of digital assets on the Cardano blockchain. The contract is designed to distribute specified amounts of tokens to recipients based on predefined conditions.

## Contract Structure
- `Airdrop.hs`: Haskell code implementing the airdrop contract logic.
- `AirdropDatum`: Custom data type representing the airdrop parameters and state.
- `mkAirdropValidator`: Validator function ensuring the correct execution of airdrop transactions.
- `airdropValidator`: Wrapped validator for use in Plutus scripts.
- `airdropScript`: Script instance for the airdrop contract.
- `airdropScriptAddress`: Address associated with the airdrop contract on the Cardano blockchain.
- `Airdrop`: Validator type instance and default data for the airdrop contract.

## Usage
To use this airdrop contract:

1. Deploy the contract to the Cardano blockchain using the provided script.
2. Interact with the contract by submitting transactions that meet the specified conditions for airdrop eligibility.
3. Monitor the contract's address for airdrop distributions and recipient claims.
