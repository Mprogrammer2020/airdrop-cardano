Cardano Airdrop Smart Contract
This repository contains a Haskell smart contract for conducting an airdrop on the Cardano blockchain using the Plutus smart contract platform.

Overview
The smart contract defines an airdrop where a specified amount of ADA is distributed to recipients who claim the airdrop. Recipients can only claim the airdrop once, and the contract ensures that the correct amount of ADA is locked in the transaction.

Usage
To use the smart contract, compile it using the Plutus compiler and deploy it to the Cardano blockchain. Recipients can then claim the airdrop by interacting with the deployed contract.
